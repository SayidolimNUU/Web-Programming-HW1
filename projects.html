        <div class='cardText'>
            <h2>
                Nand2Tetris
            </h2>
            <p>
                This project required to build a computer from scratch. It was a challenging project that taught me about computer architecture and how the tiniest parts of it combine to work together.

    <div class='card'>
        <img src='project2.jpg' alt='Project 2'>
        <div class='cardText'>
            <h2>
                Homework 1 from Web Programming
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is a project that I worked on using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a simple responsive website that adapts to different screen sizes.

    <div class='card'>
        <img src='project3.jpg' alt='Project 3'>
        <div class='cardText'>
            <h2>
                WoodPlate.uz
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is my first web project. It is a simple website that me and my brother created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                I think the website doesn't work properly now, as they didn't pay for the servers on time and some parts of it were lost completely.
